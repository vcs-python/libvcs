```{module} libvcs.pytest_plugin

```

[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/

## Usage

Install `libvcs` via the python package manager of your choosing, e.g.

```console
$ pip install libvcs
```

The pytest plugin will automatically be detected via pytest, and the fixtures will be added.

## Fixtures

`pytest-vcs` works through providing {ref}`pytest fixtures <pytest:fixtures-api>` - so read up on
those!

The plugin's fixtures guarantee a fresh git repository every test.

## Recommended fixtures

These fixtures are automatically used when the plugin is enabled and `pytest` is run.

- Creating temporary, test directories for:
  - `/home/` ({func}`home_path`)
  - `/home/${user}` ({func}`user_path`)
- Setting your home directory
  - Patch `$HOME` to point to {func}`user_path` ({func}`set_home`)
- Create configuration files:

  - `.gitconfig`, via {func}`gitconfig`
   - `.hgrc`, via {func}`hgconfig` 

- Set default configuration for VCS:

  - Set {func}`hgconfig` to [`HGRCPATH`] via {func}`set_hgconfig`
  - Set {func}`gitconfig` to [`GIT_CONFIG`] via {func}`set_gitconfig`

  These are set to ensure you can correctly clone and create repositories without without extra
  warnings.

[`HGRCPATH`]: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/hg.1.html#:~:text=UNIX%2Dlike%20environments.-,HGRCPATH,-If%20not%20set

## Bootstrapping pytest in your `conftest.py`

The most common scenario is you will want to configure the above fixtures with `autouse`.

_Why doesn't the plugin automatically add them?_ It's part of being a decent pytest plugin and
python package: explicitness.

(set_home)=

### Setting a temporary home directory

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def setup(
    set_home: None,
):
    pass
```
