# Git Commit Standards

## Format
```
type(scope[component]): concise description

why: explanation of necessity/impact
what: 
- technical changes made
- keep focused on single topic

refs: #issue-number, breaking changes, links
```

## Commit Types
- `feat`: New features/enhancements
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (deps, tooling)
- `test`: Test-related changes
- `style`: Code style/formatting

## Guidelines
- Subject line: max 50 chars
- Body lines: max 72 chars
- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- Single topic per commit
- Blank line between subject and body
- Mark breaking changes with "BREAKING:"
- Use "See also:" for external links

## AI Assistance in Cursor
- Stage changes with `git add`
- Use `@commit` to generate initial message
- Review and adjust the generated message
- Ensure it follows format above

## Examples

Good commit:
```
feat(subprocess[run]): Switch to unicode-only text handling

why: Improve consistency and type safety in subprocess handling
what:
- BREAKING: Changed run() to use text=True by default
- Removed console_to_str() helper and encoding logic
- Simplified output handling
- Updated type hints for better safety

refs: #485

```

Bad commit:
```
updated some stuff and fixed bugs
```

Cursor Rules: Add development QA and git commit standards (#cursor-rules)

- Add dev-loop.mdc: QA process for code edits
  - Type checking with mypy
  - Linting with ruff
  - Test validation with pytest
  - Ensures edits are validated before commits

- Add git-commits.mdc: Commit message standards
  - Structured format with why/what sections
  - Defined commit types and guidelines
  - Examples of good/bad commits
  - AI assistance instructions

Note: These rules help maintain code quality and commit history
consistency across the project.
