# First: QA Every edit

Run these commands between edits:

Check typings:

```
uv run mypy
```

Lint:

```
uv run ruff check . --fix; uv run ruff format .;
```

Check tests:

```
uv run py.test
```

Between every edit, rerun:
- Type checks
- Lint
- Tests

If there's any failures *due to the edits*, fix them first, then:

# When your edit is complete: Commit it

Make an atomic commit for the edit, using conventional commits.
